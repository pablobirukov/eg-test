        This application build with <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">ReactJS</a> and jQuery
        (just one call to get data from server).
        For application state management I used <a href="https://github.com/Tvaroh/moreartyjs">MoreartyJS</a> and <a
            href="https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js">Immutable</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        There is no test. At all.
    </p>

        I use AMD to manage dependencies. And there is a problem to use AMD modules in Node.
        React is pretty young and offbeat framework so there are not so many testing tools for it.
        I've found only one good thing named <a href="http://facebook.github.io/jest/">Jest</a>.
        But standard for that case (AMD in Node) Requirejs module doesn't work in Jest environment.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then I tried uRequire to translate my modules to UMD but then I got another problem with Moreary.
        It's not possible to test components without main context.
        So you have to create one more instance of component bounded to global context object.

        This short story took two hours of my life :) I haven't enough time to finish the task according to all
        requirements. But I sure that FRP is less bug-buff concept than others.

    <p>Hope you enjoy it.</p>
